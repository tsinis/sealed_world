/// An extension on [BasicFlag] to provide a `copyWith` method for creating a
/// new instance of [BasicFlag] with modified properties.
///
/// This extension allows you to create a new [BasicFlag] by copying the
/// existing one and overriding specific properties.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final newFlag = existingFlag.copyWith(aspectRatio: 1.5);
/// ```
extension BasicFlagExtensionCopyWith<T extends BasicFlag> on T {
  /// Creates a copy of this [BasicFlag] but with the given fields replaced with
  /// the new values.
  ///
  /// - [properties]: The properties of the flag.
  /// - [aspectRatio]: The aspect ratio of the flag.
  /// - [decoration]: The decoration to paint behind the flag.
  /// - [decorationPosition]: The position of the decoration.
  /// - [padding]: The padding around the flag.
  /// - [elementsBuilder]: A builder for the elements of the flag.
  /// - [backgroundPainter]: A custom painter for the background of the flag.
  /// - [foregroundPainter]: A custom painter for the foreground of the flag.
  /// - [foregroundWidget]: A widget to display in the foreground of the flag.
  /// - [foregroundPainterBuilder]: A builder for the foreground painter.
  /// - [foregroundWidgetBuilder]: A builder for the foreground widget.
