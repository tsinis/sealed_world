## 2.7.0

REFACTOR

- Made `Shape` implementations `final`; added deprecations for legacy helpers (to be replaced with modern `switch` expressions).
- Selectively disable anti-aliasing for axis-aligned rects (e.g., BLR bg, SAU sabre) to avoid blur; keep AA for diagonals.

FIX

- Oman flag default aspect ratio corrected (from 2 to 7/4).

## 2.6.0

FIX

- Corrected Welsh official country name for CuraÃ§ao.
- Corrected Korean localization for British Indian Ocean Territory, Dominica, Mongolia, Wallis and Futuna and South Georgia.
- Corrected `subunitToUnit` value for Hungarian Forint.

NEW FEATURES

- Flag anti-aliasing is now smarter - it's defined on element painters level, so rectangle elements are no longer anti-aliased.
- Added `copyWith` extension for `IsoFlag`, also exposed flag data maps `map` and `alternativeMap` via public getters for easier access.
- Added a new property `FlagElementsType? baseElementType` to flag data `FlagProperties` indicating the base geometric or symbolic element of each flag, enhancing metadata and classification.
- Also added an `isSimplified` property to flag definitions, allowing users to distinguish between simplified and fully detailed flags.
- Updated language metadata to better reflect writing systems and script directionality for [many](https://github.com/tsinis/sealed_world/pull/360/files) languages.

REFACTOR

- Deprecated ineffective anti-aliasing override `flagAntiAliasOverride` properties and improved anti-aliasing handling in flag rendering.

- Standardized code normalization using new ISO code extension types, replacing older string and object extension methods.
- Deprecated legacy constant lists in favor of centralized static lists for ISO classes.

## 2.0.0

ðŸŽ‰ Second anniversary and new major release!

NEW FEATURES

- Introduced new methods for working with common names and common name maps: `commonNamesMap` on ISO collections and `commonNameFor`/`maybeCommonNameFor` on ISO objects. These methods are significantly faster than the old `translations` - related methods because they work directly with locale-specific maps instead of iterating through all translations of each ISO object.
- The `translations` getter is now a computed field. This means it will only generate the translations when they are requested, rather than storing them all in memory. It's recommended to cache the results of the getter to avoid redundant calculations. Because of that - `translation` and `maybeTranslation` methods are no longer recommended for retrieving localization data.
- The `commonNamesCacheMap` is deprecated because it relies on the memory-intensive `translations` getter.
- New localization delegates on `IsoTranslated` objects simplify complex queries for object localizations.
- Bool getters on `IsoStandardized` objects can now be applied to null values. For example, `maybeIso.isRus` will return `false` if `maybeIso` is null, without the need for additional null-checks.

FIX

- Replaced deprecated `Color` methods `.withOpacity` with new `.withAlpha`
- Changed official name for [Portugal](https://gitlab.com/restcountries/restcountries/-/merge_requests/77): "RepÃºblica portuguÃªs" > "RepÃºblica Portuguesa".
- Change the capital of Indonesia for [Nusantara](https://gitlab.com/restcountries/restcountries/-/merge_requests/75): "Jakarta" > "Nusantara".

BREAKING CHANGES

- The package now requires Flutter v3.27.1 or higher.
- The `IsoTranslated<T, N, L>` class now uses three generic types instead of two. If you used this class directly in your code, simply add the additional generic `<L extends BasicLocale>` to your reference.
- The default `toString()` implementation of `BasicLocale` now uses Flutter's `Locale`-like output format. You can still access the old output by setting the `short` flag to `false`.
- The `sealed_country_translations` library is removed. Migrate to the [l10n_countries](https://pub.dev/packages/l10n_countries) package or use `l10n` getter in ISO objects that provides the same data without holding all translations in memory. This sub-library and its content (except for supported locales lists - they will be moved to the main library) will be removed in the next major package version.
- Country translation methods requires `BasicTypedLocale` instead of `BasicLocale`, if you didn't used country value - this change will not affect you, otherwise please change from:

```dart
BasicLocale(*, countryCode: "US");
```

to:

```dart
BasicTypedLocale(*, regionalCode: "US"); // or BasicTypedLocale(*, country: CountryUsa());
```
