This ISO-driven, pure Dart, fully tested and and 3rd-party dependency-free package provides information about world currencies in form of compile-time constant sealed classes. Contains the all actively used 169[^1] currencies with ISO letter 4217 codes, also provides ISO 4217 numeric codes, their English, native names, units, subunits, currency name translations, etc. For Flutter ready widgets (like currency picker) please use [world_countries](https://pub.dev/packages/world_countries) package.

### Features

**FiatCurrency** class provides the following information about currencies:

| Field                | Required | Description                                                                             | Example for FiatEur                           |

Compile time constant list of all currencies accessible via `FiatCurrency.list` and more over, the **FiatCurrency** class provides the following methods/constructors:

- `permissive` - allows the creation of custom class instances that are not fully compatible with the ISO standard.
- `maybeFromValue` - returns a currency instance if the value matches the provided value, otherwise returns `null`.
- `maybeFromAnyCode` - returns a currency instance if the value matches any ISO 4217 code, otherwise returns `null`.
- `fromCode` - returns a currency instance if the value matches the provided ISO 4217 letter code.
- `fromCodeNumeric` - returns a currency instance if the value matches the provided ISO 4217 numeric code.
- `fromAnyCode` - returns a currency instance if the value matches any ISO 4217 code.
- `fromName` - returns a currency instance if the value matches the provided English name.

and (thanks to sealed nature of the class) functional-style like methods: `whenOrNull`, `maybeWhen`, `when`, `map`, `maybeMap`. You can also find a lot of common method you may know from Dart ecosystem - `toString` overrides, `copyWith`, `toJson`, etc.

> Translations: Use `maybeTranslation()` or `translation()` methods to get translations for specific locale.

### Getting started

To use this package, add `sealed_currencies` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  sealed_currencies: any
```

Then import the package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:sealed_currencies/sealed_currencies.dart';
```

### Usage

Use `FiatCurrency` class to get information about currencies. Either construct a new instance directly, or with use of the class factory constructors/static methods or select one from the `FiatCurrency.list` constant.

```dart
  print(FiatCurrency.listExtended.length); // Prints: "169".
  print(FiatCurrency.list.length); // Prints: "159".

  final serbianDinar = FiatCurrency.fromCode("Rsd");
  print(serbianDinar); // Prints: "Serbian Dinar".

  final maybeEuro = FiatCurrency.maybeFromValue(
    "Euro",
    where: (currency) => currency.namesNative.first,
  );
  print(maybeEuro?.toString(short: false));
  /*
  Prints: "FiatCurrency(code: "EUR", name: "Euro", decimalMark: ",",
  thousandsSeparator: ".", symbol: "€", alternateSymbols: null,
  disambiguateSymbol: null, htmlEntity: "€", codeNumeric: "978", namesNative:
  ["Euro"], priority: 2, smallestDenomination: 1, subunit: "Cent",
  subunitToUnit: 100, unitFirst: true, translations rsdCurrencyTranslations)".
  */

  // Prints German translations of all available regular currencies.
  for (final currency in FiatCurrency.list) {
    print(
      """German name of ${currency.name}: ${currency.maybeTranslation(const LangDeu())?.name}""",
    );
  }
```

### FAQ

#### Why should I use this package over any other currency-related package?

- **Sealed classes**: This package provides data in the form of sealed classes, allowing you to create your own instances and work with them as with existing ones (for example this is not possible with enums or regular classes, you can also override existing data, etc.).
- **No 3rd-party dependencies**: This package has no third-party dependencies, ensuring that you won't have any issues or conflicts with other dependencies (no even `meta` here, because of that).
- **Rich data**: This package offers far more data than any other package + tons of translations (all GlobalMaterialLocalizations and GlobalCupertinoLocalizations locales and more).
- **Type-safe**: The contracts and types in this package are very strong, ensuring that your code is strongly typed and well-defined.
- **High code coverage**: The code in this package has a high level of coverage, providing confidence in its reliability and stability.
- **Industry adopted**: This package is actively used in production by numerous European companies, ensuring its efficacy and robustness in real-world scenarios.
- **MIT License**: This package and sources are released under the MIT license, which is a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the code with minimal restrictions. The MIT license is considered better than most other open-source licenses because it provides flexibility and allows users to incorporate the code into their projects without worrying about legal implications.
