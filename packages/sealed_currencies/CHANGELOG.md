## 1.3.1

NEW FEATURES

- Fix thousands separator for [CHF](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money/pull/1072).
- `codeOther` is no longer nullable (in all `IsoStandardized` classes).
- Added new compile time constant and case-insensitive code maps (`UpperCaseIsoMap`s) in every ISO class (accessible as static constants via `.map`, `.codeMap`, `.codeNumericMap` etc.).
- Factory constructors and methods now using those maps if no (optional) array is provided there.
- Factory constructors and methods in `IsoStandardized` classes now allow non-String inputs - any `Object`, for example you can now use `StringBuffer` or `Enum` instances directly:

```dart
 enum IsoEnum {de, fr, ar} // On .fromCode(IsoEnum.de) call it will use "DE" input.
```

or you can basically use any custom class with `toString()` override:

```dart
class CustomIsoCodeClass {
 const CustomIsoCodeClass({String code = '123', this.foo}) : _code = code;
 final String _code;
 final Foo? foo;

 @override
 String toString() => _code; // Has to override toString() with ISO value.
}

// On .fromAnyCode(CustomIsoCodeClass(code: ' 321 ')) call it will use "321" input.
```

REFACTOR

- Refactored asserts in `maybeMapIsoCode` method.
- Fixed typos in CHANGELOG and README.

## 1.2.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new static `maybeFrom*` methods and refactored old ones. They are also now accept any `Object?` input instead of just `String?`.
- Added new and refactored old tests with a performance in mind.
- Added new `firstIsoWhere*` extensions on ISO iterables.
- Added `is*` boolean getters for example:

```dart
if (isoObject.isUsd) return _onUsDollar();
```

is more readable and shorter equivalent of this check:

```dart
if (isoObject == const FiatUsd()) return _onUsDollar();
```

## 1.1.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new constructor called `permissive` - which allow the creation of custom class instances that are not fully compatible with the ISO standard.
- `Translated` class is now sealed - which means you can now directly compare instances of different ISO classes directly (for example in switch statements).

## 1.0.0

ðŸŽ‰ First anniversary and first stable release!

NEW FEATURES

- Added new getter for `TranslatedName` name called `common`, which might be useful in some cases when `name` is being used by a parent class.
- Added a lot of translations from the Symfony.
- ðŸ¦¾ Currencies translations now support all `GlobalMaterialLocalizations` + `GlobalCupertinoLocalizations` locales.
- Updated LICENSE.

BREAKING CHANGES

- Removed code marked as `Deprecated` in previous releases.
- Replaced old `FiatCurrency.list` with a new `FiatCurrency.listExtended`.
- Removed `FiatCurrency.regularList` (please use `FiatCurrency.list` instead).
- Marked Croatian Kuna as `Deprecated`.

## 0.9.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new interface `IsoTranslated` which combines `Translated` and `IsoStandardized` interfaces.
- Added `standard*` static constants in FiatCurrency class referencing different names of the ISO 4217 standard.
- Improved documentation in README, added FAQ.
- Updated example with translations.

## 0.8.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new factory to FiatCurrency - fromAnyCode, which do the length and type checks and redirects to other fromCode\* constructors
- Added new static method to FiatCurrency - maybeFromAnyCode, which works same way as fromAnyCode, but doesn't throws StateErrors if no currency object is found.
- Added maybeMapIsoCode method to String extensions, which is used under the hood of (maybe)fromAnyCode.

REFACTOR

- Named classes now has boolean flag (short, defaults to true).
- TranslatedName class by default returns "name" value on toString().
- Refactored dollar symbols in toString() methods.

## 0.7.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added regularList getter for list of regular currencies (excludes 10 currencies from specialPurposeList).
- FiatCurrency class now contains translations of language name to other languages (79 translations for each language minimum).
- Those translations are also accessible via translation and maybeTranslation methods.
- Refactored factory constructors - there is an optional parameter to provide custom list.
- Added TranslatedName class for translations.
- Implement new abstract interfaces for currencies: Named and Translated.
- Fixed several English currency names.

## 0.6.0

- feat(model): added copy with, to-json etc.
- fix(data): proper alternate symbols list for scandinavian countries

NEW FEATURES

- Added copyWith, toJson etc. to the FiatCurrency class.
- Fixed the alternate symbols list for scandinavian countries.

## 0.5.0

- refactor(model): factory constructors and static methods for data classes creation now implicitly trimming and comparing uppercase string inputs
- refactor(lints): fixing old ignores and new linter rules
- chore(deps): updates of dev_dependencies

BREAKING CHANGES

- refactor(data)!: zimbabwean dollar (zwl) is now properly placed as last item in currencies list
