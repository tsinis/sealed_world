## 1.3.0

NEW FEATURES

- `codeOther` is no longer nullable (in all `IsoStandardized` classes).
- Added new compile time constant and case-insensitive code maps (`UpperCaseIsoMap`s) in every ISO class (accessible as static constants via `.map`, `.codeMap`, `.codeShort` etc.).
- Factory constructors and methods now using those maps if no (optional) array is provided there.
- Factory constructors and methods in `IsoStandardized` classes now allow non-String - any `Object`s, for example you can now use `StringBuffer` or `Enum` instances directly:

```dart
 enum IsoEnum {de, fr, ar} // On .fromCode(IsoEnum.de) call it will use "DE" input.
```

or you can basically use any custom class with `toString()` override:

```dart
class CustomIsoCodeClass {
 const CustomIsoCodeClass({String code = '123', this.foo}) : _code = code;
 final String _code;
 final Foo? foo;

 @override
 String toString() => _code; // Has to override toString() with ISO value.
}

// On .fromAnyCode(CustomIsoCodeClass(code: ' 321 ')) call it will use "321" input.
```

## 1.2.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new static `maybeFrom*` methods and refactored old ones. They are also now accept any `Object?` input instead of just `String?`.
- Added new and refactored old tests with a performance in mind.
- Added new `firstIsoWhere*` extensions on ISO iterables.
- Added `is*` boolean getters for example:

```dart
if (isoObject.isFra) return _onFrench();
```

is more readable and shorter equivalent of this check:

```dart
if (isoObject == const LangFra()) return _onFrench();
```

## 1.1.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new constructor called `permissive` - which allow the creation of custom class instances that are not fully compatible with the ISO standard.
- `Translated` class is now sealed - which means you can now directly compare instances of different ISO classes directly (for example in switch statements).

## 1.0.0

ðŸŽ‰ First anniversary and first stable release!

NEW FEATURES

- Added new getter for `TranslatedName` name called `common`, which might be useful in some cases when `name` is being used by a parent class.
- Added a lot of translations from the Symfony.
- Updated LICENSE.

## 0.9.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new interface `IsoTranslated` which combines `Translated` and `IsoStandardized` interfaces.
- Added `standard*` static constants in ISO classes referencing different names of specific standards.
- Improved documentation in README, added FAQ.

> Note: Please make sure to replace deprecated methods with suggested replacements, because all of them will be removed in version 1.0.0.

## 0.8.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new factories to Script and NaturalLanguage - fromAnyCode, which do the length and type checks and redirects to other fromCode\* constructors
- Added new static methods to Script and NaturalLanguage - maybeFromAnyCode, which works same way as fromAnyCode, but doesn't throws StateErrors if no ISO object is found.
- Added maybeMapIsoCode method to String extensions, which is used under the hood of (maybe)fromAnyCode.

REFACTOR

- Renamed isIsoCode to isIsoAlphaRegularCode.

- Named classes now has boolean flag (short, defaults to true).
- TranslatedName class by default returns "name" value on toString().
- Refactored dollar symbols in toString() methods.

## 0.7.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new sealed class - Scripts, comes from ISO 15924 standard.
- NaturalLanguage class now contains info about scripts (writing systems) and translations of language name to other languages.
- Added translation and maybeTranslation methods for Translated classes (NaturalLanguage).
- Refactored factory constructors for IsoStandardized classes - there is an optional parameter to provide custom list
- Added TranslatedName class for translations.
- Added new abstract interfaces: Named and Translated.

## 0.6.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new interfaces (IsoStandardized, JsonEncodable) and typedef (JsonMap) to the model.
- Added copyWith, toJson etc. to the NaturalLanguage class.
- Fixed the names native list for Sindhi in the data.
