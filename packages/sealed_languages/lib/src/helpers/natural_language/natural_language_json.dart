  ///
  /// - `"name"`: Required. A string that represents the name of the language.
  /// - `"code"`: Required. A string that represents the ISO 639-1 code of the

  /// - `"codeShort"`: Required. A string that represents the short code of the

  /// - `"namesNative"`: Required. A string that represents the native names
  ///    of the language, separated by the [JsonEncodable.separator] character.
  /// - `"family"`: A string that represents the name of the language family.
  /// - `"isRightToLeft"`: A boolean that indicates whether the language is
  ///   written from right to left.

  /// ```dart
