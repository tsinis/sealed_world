This ISO-driven and fully tested package provides information about world countries, currencies, languages, etc. in form of compile-time constant sealed classes with a customizable pickers. This is Flutter wrapper on top of the [sealed_countries](https://pub.dev/packages/sealed_countries) package, that extends the data (for example different flag types in form of color fonts, Twemoji, Noto Color Emoji, OpenMoji) and provides ready-to use widgets for showing countries, languages, currencies lists and pickers.

## Features

This package provides the following ready-to-use widgets:

* `CountryPicker` - A picker widget that displays a list of world countries.
* `PhoneCodePicker` - A picker widget that displays a list of phone codes.
* `CurrencyPicker` - A picker widget that displays a list of fiat currencies.
* `LanguagePicker` - A picker widget that displays a list of natural languages.

Or you can just create your own pickers by extending `BasicPicker`.

## Getting started

To use this package, you will need Flutter version 3.10+. Add `world_countries` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  world_countries: any
```

## Usage

You can use provided widgets directly, or just use their methods:

* showInModalBottomSheet
* showInSearch
* showInDialog

For example:

```dart
import "dart:async" show unawaited;

import "package:flutter/material.dart";
import "package:world_countries/world_countries.dart";

class MainPage extends StatefulWidget {
  const MainPage({super.key});

  @override
  State<MainPage> createState() => _MainPageState();
}

class _MainPageState extends State<MainPage>
    with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  WorldCountry? selectedCountry;

  late final CountryPicker countryPicker = CountryPicker(
    disabled: const [CountryAfg(), CountryAlb()],
    onSelect: onSelect,
  );

  void onSelect(WorldCountry newCountry) {
    print("New country selected: $newCountry");
    setState(() => selectedCountry = newCountry);
  }

  void onFabPressed({bool isLongPress = false}) {
    final picker = PhoneCodePicker.fromCountryPicker(countryPicker);
    unawaited(
      isLongPress
          ? picker.showInDialog(context)
          : picker.showInModalBottomSheet(context),
    );
  }

  void onAppBarSearchPressed() =>
      unawaited(countryPicker.showInSearch(context));

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          actions: [
            IconButton(
              onPressed: onAppBarSearchPressed,
              icon: const Icon(Icons.search),
            ),
          ],
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: MaybeWidget(
            selectedCountry?.name.common,
            Text.new,
            orElse: const Text(
              "Please select country by pressing on the search icon",
            ),
          ),
        ),
        floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
          onPressed: onFabPressed,
          child: const Icon(Icons.search),
        ),
