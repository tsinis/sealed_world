# Material Theme Builder Flutter Export

## Basics

This archive contains a number of files defining a Material 3 theme:

 * colors_schemes.g.dart        - contains all colors used by your theme

Your colors and schemes will be generated in a color_schemes.g.dart file to avoid collision
with other files that may exist in your project.
