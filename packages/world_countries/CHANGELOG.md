## 1.1.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new constructor called `permissive` - which allow the creation of custom class instances that are not fully compatible with the ISO standard.
- `Translated` class is now sealed - which means you can now directly compare instances of different ISO classes directly (for example in switch statements).

- Added theme extensions that you can specify in your `ThemeData` to provide global theme to your pickers. You can find `PickersThemeData`, `CountryTileThemeData`, `CurrencyTileThemeData` and `LanguageTileThemeData`:

```dart
MaterialApp(
  ...
  theme: ThemeData(
    /// And also [CurrencyTileThemeData], [LanguageTileThemeData]...
    extensions: const <ThemeExtension>[
      PickersThemeData(primary: true), // Specify global pickers theme.
      CountryTileThemeData(emojiFamily: EmojiFamily.twemoji),
    ],
  )
);
```

This way you can specify for example that all your pickers lists are primary and define globally use of Twemoji as main flags font emoji family in all Country/Phone pickers in the app.

## 1.0.0

ðŸŽ‰ First anniversary and first stable release!

NEW FEATURES

- Added new getter for `TranslatedName` name called `common`, which might be useful in some cases when `name` is being used by a parent class.
- Added a lot of translations from the Symfony.
- Currencies translations now support all GlobalMaterialLocalizations and GlobalCupertinoLocalizations locales.
- Updated LICENSE.

- Added CLI tool for removing unused emoji font families on the Web platform `dart run world_countries:clean_build [--keep twemoji,notoemoji,openmoji]`
- Added `fromSubtags` constructors for `IsoLocale` and `TypedLocale` classes.
- Added `defaultLocaleMapResolution` for a `TypedLocaleDelegate` that maps:
  - `fil` Filipino (Pilipino) to `tl` Tagalog.
  - `gsw` Swiss German Alemannic Alsatian to `de_CH` German (Switzerland).
  - `bs_Cyrl` Bosnian (written in the Cyrillic script) to `sr` Serbian.

BREAKING CHANGES

- Removed code marked as `Deprecated` in previous releases.
- Replaced old `FiatCurrency.list` with a new `FiatCurrency.listExtended`.
- Removed `FiatCurrency.regularList` (please use `FiatCurrency.list` instead).
- Marked Croatian Kuna as `Deprecated` (currencies).
- Moved helpers of world_country package to separate library: `BuildContextExtension`, `FunctionalPlatform`, `NameTextInput`, `ClearButton` and `UiConstants`. To migrate just use IDE suggestions or manually replace old references:

```dart
import "package:world_countries/world_countries.dart";
```

to a new one:

```dart
import "package:world_countries/helpers.dart";
```

## 0.9.0

NEW FEATURES

- Added new interface `IsoTranslated` which combines `Translated` and `IsoStandardized`interfaces.
- Added `standard*` static constants in WorldCountry class referencing different names of the ISO 3166-1 standard.
- Improved documentation in README, added FAQ and demo web-site (Flutter WASM).

REFACTORING

- Removed `NavigatorContextExtension` from exports, so you don't need to specify it no longer via `hide`.

## 0.8.0

BREAKING CHANGE

- Country and PhoneCode pickers now using `TypedLocale` as translation parameter (to migrate just wrap your previous language there with IsoLocale()).

NEW FEATURES

- Added the `TypedLocaleDelegate` class, which can be used in the `localizationsDelegates` (such as in `MaterialApp`). It attempts to convert the string-based `Locale` to a strongly typed `TypedLocale`, which is then used in all pickers to provide translations for country/currency/language names. The detected TypedLocale? is also accessible via `TypedLocaleDelegate.maybeOf(context)` or simply `context.maybeLocale`.
- All pickers can have a local translation override via the `translation` parameter (which will be used instead of the TypedLocale translation).
- Translated classes now also have translate() and maybeTranslate() methods to translate it's data (country/currency/language names).

- Added new factories to ISO classes - fromAnyCode, which do the length and type checks and redirects to other fromCode\* constructors.
- Added new static method to ISO classes - maybeFromAnyCode, which works same way as fromAnyCode, but doesn't throws StateErrors if no currency object is found.
- Added maybeMapIsoCode method to String extensions, which is used under the hood of (maybe)fromAnyCode.

REFACTOR

- Slightly changed UI of default picker's tiles - added padding on top of the leading widget and swapped title with subtitle (because of translations provided to title).
- Named classes now has boolean flag (short, defaults to true).
- TranslatedName class by default returns "name" value on toString().
- Refactored dollar symbols in toString() methods.

## 0.7.0

This is a general update that synchronizes underlying Dart package updates (related to translations and interfaces), as a preparation for a bigger upcoming update for localization delegates.

NEW FEATURES

- Added and updated translations for currencies, languages, and countries (79 translations for each minimum).
- Added translation and maybeTranslation methods for Translated classes.
- Refactored factory constructors for IsoStandardized classes. There is an optional parameter to provide a custom list.

- Added a new sealed class called Scripts, based on the ISO 15924 standard.
- The NaturalLanguage class now contains information about scripts (writing systems) and translations of the language name to other languages.

- Added a regularList getter for a list of regular currencies (excluding 10 currencies from the specialPurposeList).
- Fixed several English currency names.
