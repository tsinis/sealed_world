## 0.8.0

BREAKING CHANGE

- Country and PhoneCode pickers now using `TypedLocale` as translation parameter (to migrate just wrap your previous language there with IsoLocale()).

NEW FEATURES

- Added the `TypedLocaleDelegate` class, which can be used in the `localizationsDelegates` (such as in `MaterialApp`). It attempts to convert the string-based `Locale` to a strongly typed `TypedLocale`, which is then used in all pickers to provide translations for country/currency/language names. The detected TypedLocale? is also accessible via `TypedLocaleDelegate.maybeOf(context)` or simply `context.maybeLocale`.
- All pickers can have a local translation override via the `translation` parameter (which will be used instead of the TypedLocale translation).
- Translated classes now also have translate() and maybeTranslate() methods to translate it's data (country/currency/language names).

- Added new factories to ISO classes - fromAnyCode, which do the length and type checks and redirects to other fromCode* constructors.
- Added new static method to ISO classes - maybeFromAnyCode, which works same way as fromAnyCode, but doesn't throws StateErrors if no currency object is found.
- Added maybeMapIsoCode method to String extensions, which is used under the hood of (maybe)fromAnyCode.

REFACTOR

- Slightly changed UI of default picker's tiles - added padding on top of the leading widget and swapped title with subtitle (because of translations provided to title).
- Named classes now has boolean flag (short, defaults to true).
- TranslatedName class by default returns "name" value on toString().
- Refactored dollar symbols in toString() methods.

## 0.7.0

This is a general update that synchronizes underlying Dart package updates (related to translations and interfaces), as a preparation for a bigger upcoming update for localization delegates.

NEW FEATURES

- Added and updated translations for currencies, languages, and countries (79 translations for each minimum).
- Added translation and maybeTranslation methods for Translated classes.
- Refactored factory constructors for IsoStandardized classes. There is an optional parameter to provide a custom list.

- Added a new sealed class called Scripts, based on the ISO 15924 standard.
- The NaturalLanguage class now contains information about scripts (writing systems) and translations of the language name to other languages.

- Added a regularList getter for a list of regular currencies (excluding 10 currencies from the specialPurposeList).
- Fixed several English currency names.

## 0.6.0

NEW FEATURE: New searchSuggestions method in every picker (for use in `suggestionsBuilder` of [SearchAnchor](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SearchAnchor-class.html))

- refactor(mixin): added new mixins
- refactor(docs): improve example and docs
- feat(ui): added search suggestions for search anchors

## 0.5.0

- refactor(model): factory constructors and static methods for data classes creation now implicitly trimming and comparing uppercase string inputs
- feat(model): added new data sealed classes related to world blocs

- refactor(lints): fixing old ignores and new linter rules
