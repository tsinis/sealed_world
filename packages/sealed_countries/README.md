### Features

**WorldCountry** class provides the following information about countries:

Compile time constant list of all countries accessible via `WorldCountry.list` and more over, the **WorldCountry** class provides the following methods/constructors:

- `permissive` - allows the creation of custom class instances that are not fully compatible with the ISO standard.
- `maybeFromAnyCode` - returns a country instance if the value matches any ISO 3166 code, otherwise returns `null`.
- `fromAnyCode` - returns a country instance if the value matches any ISO 4217 code.
- `maybeFromValue` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided value, otherwise returns `null`.
- `fromCode` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code.
- `fromCodeShort` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code.
- `fromCodeNumeric` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 numeric code.
- `maybeFromCode` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code, otherwise returns `null`.
- `maybeFromCodeShort` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 code, otherwise returns `null`.
- `maybeFromCodeNumeric` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 numeric code, otherwise returns `null`.

and (thanks to sealed nature of the class) functional-style like methods: `whenOrNull`, `maybeWhen`, `when`, `map`, `maybeMap` and `is*` boolean getters. You can also find a lot of common method you may know from Dart ecosystem - `toString` overrides, `copyWith`, `toJson`, etc. Also a compile time const, tree-shakable, case case insensitive code `map`s (for a 0(1) access time code mapping), `list` and much more.

> Translations: Use `maybeTranslation()` or `translation()` methods to get translations for specific locale.

### Getting started

To use this package, add `sealed_countries` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  sealed_countries: any
```

Then import the package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:sealed_countries/sealed_countries.dart';
```

### Usage

Use `WorldCountry` class to get information about countries. Either construct a new instance directly or with use of the class factory constructors/static methods, or select one from the `WorldCountry.list` constant.

```dart
  print(WorldCountry.list.length); // Prints: "250".

  final country = WorldCountry.fromCode("MEX");
  print(country.name.common); // Prints: "Mexico".
  print(country.isMex); // Prints: true.

  final europeanCountries = WorldCountry.list.where(
    (country) => country.continent is Europe,
  );
  print(europeanCountries); // Prints a list of European countries.

  for (final country in WorldCountry.list) {
  print(
    """${country.internationalName} translated to Slovak language: ${country.translation(BasicLocale(LangSlk())).name}""",
  );
}
```

### FAQ

#### Why should I use this package over any other country-related package?

- **Sealed classes**: This package provides data in the form of sealed classes, allowing you to create your own instances and work with them as with existing ones (for example this is not possible with enums or regular classes (without losing it's sealed nature), you can also override existing or add new data, etc.).
- **No 3rd-party dependencies**: This package has no third-party dependencies, ensuring that you won't have any issues or conflicts with other dependencies (no even `meta` here, because of that).
- **Rich data**: This package offers far more data than any other package + tons of translations (all [GlobalMaterialLocalizations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/GlobalMaterialLocalizations-class.html) and [GlobalCupertinoLocalizations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/GlobalCupertinoLocalizations-class.html) locales and more).
- **Type-safe**: The contracts and types in this package are very strong, ensuring that your code is strongly typed and well-defined.
- **High code coverage**: The code in this package has 100% code coverage, with more than 1021 (+2117 in underling packages) tests, providing confidence in its reliability and stability.
- **Industry adopted**: This package is actively used in production by numerous European companies, ensuring its efficacy and robustness in real-world scenarios.
- **MIT License**: This package and sources are released under the MIT license, which is a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the code with minimal restrictions.
