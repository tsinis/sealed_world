- `maybeFromCodeNumeric` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided ISO 3166-1 numeric code, otherwise returns `null`.
- `maybeFromValue` - returns a country instance if the value matches the provided value, otherwise returns `null`.

You can also find many common methods you may know from Dart ecosystem - `toString` overrides, `copyWith`, `toJson`, `compareTo`, etc. Also, a compile-time const, tree-shakable, case-insensitive code `map`s (for O(1)-time code look-ups), `list`, and much more.

> [!TIP]
> Translations: Use `maybeCommonNameFor()` or `commonNameFor()` methods to get translations for specific locale.

### Getting started

To use this package, add `sealed_countries` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  sealed_countries: any
```

Then import the package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:sealed_countries/sealed_countries.dart';
```

### Usage

To get information about countries, use the `WorldCountry` class. Use the class's factory constructors or static methods, or select a country from the `WorldCountry.list` constant.

```dart
  print(WorldCountry.list.length); // Prints: "250".

  final country = WorldCountry.fromCode("MEX");
  print(country.name.common); // Prints: "Mexico".

  final europeanCountries = WorldCountry.list.where(
    (cnt) => cnt.continent is Europe,
  );
  print(europeanCountries); // Prints a list of European countries.

  // Prints German translations of all available regular countries.
  final germanNames = WorldCountry.list.commonNamesMap(
    options: const LocaleMappingOptions(
      mainLocale: BasicTypedLocale(LangDeu()),
    ),
  );

  print(
    """Fully translated to German: ${germanNames.length == WorldCountry.list.length}""",
  ); // Prints: "Fully translated to German: true".
  for (final deuTranslation in germanNames.entries) {
    print("German name of ${deuTranslation.key.name}: ${deuTranslation.value}");
  }
```

> [!TIP]
> Also supports Dart 3.10 dot-shorthands:

```dart
print(<WorldCountry>[.chn(), .ind(), .usa(), .bra(), .jpn()].length); // 5.
```

### FAQ

#### How do I get all countries using a specific currency?

- **Quick/simple way (more suitable for a single currency):** `.where`

  ```dart
  final usdCountries = WorldCountry.list.where( // All countries using USD.
    (country) => country.currencies?.contains(const FiatUsd()) ?? false,
  );
  ```

- **Advanced (more suitable for multiple currencies, [sorted by population](https://github.com/tsinis/sealed_world/blob/main/packages/sealed_countries/lib/src/collections/README.currencies.md)):** `.byCountryMap()`

  ```dart
  final map = const [FiatUsd(), FiatEur()].byCountryMap(); // All countries using USD or EUR.
  final allCountries = {for (final list in map.values) ...list};
  ```

#### Why should I use this package over any other country-related package?

- **Classes with a sealed origin**: This package provides data via classes with a sealed origin, defining specific permitted direct subclasses. This lets you use instances of these subclasses and customize their data or behavior (e.g., overriding methods), offering more structured flexibility than enums or standard open classes.
- **No 3rd-party dependencies**: This package has no third-party dependencies, ensuring that you won't have any issues or conflicts with other dependencies (no even `meta` here, because of that).
- **Rich data**: This package offers far more data than any other package + tons of translations (all [GlobalMaterialLocalizations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/GlobalMaterialLocalizations-class.html) and [GlobalCupertinoLocalizations](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_localizations/GlobalCupertinoLocalizations-class.html) locales and more).
- **Type-safe**: The contracts and types in this package are exceptionally strong, ensuring that your code is strongly typed and well-defined.
- **High code coverage**: The code in this package has 100% code coverage, with more than 1K (+2K in underlying packages) tests, providing confidence in its reliability and stability.
- **Comprehensive documentation**: This package provides full documentation for every non-code generated public member, usually with examples, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- **Lightweight**: This package keeps **under 500 KB**, ensuring it fits within the pub cache limit. This leads to quick, low-bandwidth downloads and faster caching, minimizing resource impact.
- **Mirrored Repository**: The GitHub repository, including all package tags, is mirrored on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/tsinis/sealed_world/), providing an alternative access point should GitHub become unavailable.
- **Industry adopted**: This package is actively used in production by numerous European companies, ensuring its efficacy and robustness in real-world scenarios.
- **MIT license**: This package and sources are released under the MIT license, which is a permissive license that allows users to use, modify, and distribute the code with minimal restrictions. The MIT license is considered better than most other open-source licenses because it provides flexibility and allows users to incorporate the code into their projects without worrying about legal implications.
